=========================================================
UPGRADING TO 1.3:

1. Backup your code and database
2. Turn on maintenance mode (admin/settings/site-maintenance)
3. Replace your codebase (excluding the sites directory) with the contents of this archive.
 - It is important that you do not *merge* the new codebase, as a number of modules were
   remove or relocated!
4. Update your site via /update.php (run this twice to be safe)
5. Ignore any errors about missing included/required files 
 - Those are caused by some modules changing location
 - Ignore SQL errors from Context and/or Rules
6. View the status of the features (admin/build/features)
7. If any features are overridden, view the components of the feature that are overridden
 - It's recommended that you revert all the overridden components, but be aware that
   this will revert any custom changes you've made to those components
8. Review the available Contexts (admin/build/context)
 - Delete or disable context_ui-dashboard-dashboard, as it's no longer used by Commons
   but may still be saved in your database
9. Review the available Pages (admin/build/pages)
 - Delete or disable page-Home, as it's no longer used by Commons but may
   still be saved in your database
 - Being that Commons 1.2 now comes with a new home page, you may want to review
   it and make any changes you deem necessary
10. Review your input format and filters. WYSIWYG Filter has been set to be used
  in place of HTML Filter (for the Filtered HTML format)
11. Clear the cache (admin/settings/performance)
12. Ensure the rest of your site is functioning as expected
13. Check the status report for any errors. Address them, if needed. 

=========================================================
NOTES FOR 1.3:

- Excluded module updates:
  * User terms
    - Commons 1.0 contained a large patch which introduced free-tagging to
      user terms. Until we re-evaluate exactly what functionality we want
      for user tagging, we will continue to use the version that we started
      with.
